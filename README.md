# Differential operator in Maple
In Maple, there is a package, ore_algebra, dealing with *ore-algebra*, while differential-algebra is one kinf of special ore-algebra. But when I try to deal with differential operator which includes integral, I just cannot figure out how to use this package. 
## To-do-list
 + find a way using ore-algebra
 + build a specail algebra by own (which seems crazy)
 
# Othere methods
Anyway, I find a stupid way to verify and calculating these type operators by define my onw function. 

# Examples
All examples come from this paper: [Evolution equations possesing infinitely many symmetries](http://www.math.umn.edu/~olver/s_/eeis.pdf).
